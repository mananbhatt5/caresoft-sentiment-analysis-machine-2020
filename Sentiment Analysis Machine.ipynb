On the first night, after a 9 hour flight, reception did not advice of an event, the music was so loud the walls were vibrating in my room.

    "    reviewList.append(\"I absolutely LOVE this property and will stay here every opportunity I get when I want to travel to NYC. I do want to make you aware that the people who handle the reservations do not provide the same high level of customer service that the Hotel staff does. Is this an outsourced area of service? The difference in customer service is staggering. When I booked my reservation back in January I was connected to a reservation specialist who was flat and apathetic. She invited me to become a World of Hyatt member, but could not effectively explain the benefits. However, I still accepted the offer. Later, I needed to make a change to my reservation due to unforeseen circumstances (I needed to move my check-out date up by one day) and I was informed by another reservation specialist that the price for one night instead of two had more than doubled! I asked for an explanation and the agent could not provide one other than to repeat that the rate had changed. She was very flat and apathetic as well and she did not seem to care about my predicament. It seemed ridiculous to pay more for one night then I was originally going to pay for two and since the agent was not trying to help me understand, I reluctantly decided to cancel altogether. This was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT to me as I was so looking forward to my stay. My sister saw how upset I was and decided to call back. She spoke with a manager at the actual property. Her name was Myra and she was VERY HELPFUL and SYMPATHETIC!!! She apologized, rebooked my stay and upgraded us to a room with AN AMAZING northeast panoramic view! It was breathtaking! I was BEYOND GRATEFUL and COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY!!! This is the type of service that I have come to enjoy from the staff at Hyatt Regency Jersey City property!!! I LOVE the way you treat me!!! If the folks who handle registrations are not able to live up to the property’s high-lever customer service standard, I would urge you to coach them ASAP as it can potentially harm the impeccable reputation of the property.\")\n",

    "    reviewList.append(\"Rooms are tired. Dark, poorly lit. Especially the bathroom. The mirror is a MILE away! Not designed by a woman. Impossible to tweeze an eyebrow or apply makeup, between the dim lighting and the too deep counter. Storing toiletries on the dark shelves, deep under the dark sink is . . . one of the worst design flaws I've experienced in a hotel. It's like they're trying to make life difficult. There's a large piece of furniture (bench? luggage rack?) crowding the doorway of the room, it's so filhy I hesitate to touch it, and, again - it blocks access to the floor length mirror behind it. It's a theme! BUT THE WORST THING IS: No restaurant! Although the website promotes \\\"The Vu\\\" restaurant, it's closed for dinner, and has been for months. Staff told us it's more profitable for the hotel to use the space for private group dining. So you can SEE other people dining in the restaurant and enjoying the magnificent view, but that's just to tantalize/irritate you!! YOU aren't allowed!\")\n",

    "    reviewList.append(\"On June 1st we stayed at the Hyatt in jersey city. I bought my husband Red Sox vs Yankees tickets for his birthday and we decided to stay here and take the ferry over. The hotel stay was not cheap, but it was a beautiful view- so i decided to splurge. The valet parking was overly priced at $53.00, but the only other option we had was to park about ten minutes down the road in a random garage so we decided it would be “safer” to go through the hotel. After coming back from the game on June 2nd around 1230 pm the valet parking man “femi” was sitting on the counter texting and informed me it might “be awhile” until i get my car and said it was now going to cost me $76.00 for the valet because it was 12:30pm which now counts as a Monday. The total cost of the ONE NIGHT stay was going to be well over $400.00- which trust me was not worth it. Femi pulled up with my car and the entire right side was scratched, dented and had white paint all over it. As anyone would be- my husband and i were livid. After asking to speak with a manager Femi’s response was “well i didn’t do it wasn’t my shift and there is no manager”. He laughed in my face multiple times and said the company wouldn’t be able to do anything for me because there is no proof that it wasn’t on there before unless someone took pictures, but i could call back later. My husband went and got the man at the front desk and he attempted to help but really couldn’t do much. The next day i called the number i was given to follow up with and they said they would file a claim and get back to me “as soon as possible”. I still haven’t heard anything- but don’t worry they still charged my credit card. I asked for them to at least comp me my stay so i could pay for my car to be fixed and they told me no because the valet company isn’t part of the hotel. I have to get the car fixed so the paint on my car doesn’t rust, so i will have to pay that out of my own pocket as well since this hotel doesn’t seem to care at all. This was the absolute worst service i have ever experienced. Not only did they damage my car- but then their employee laughed in my face about it. I’m so disappointed in this hotel.\")\n",
    "    reviewList.append(\"This Hyatt was absolutely beautiful with stunning views of the Hudson River and skyline. The corner room was spacious, very clean with comfortable beds and furniture. The breakfast was delicious with great choices. The hospitality shared by staff such as the Front Office Host, Shah Bagramwal, was so inviting, professional, and caring of our needs that we decided to return for a future family celebration next year.

Immediately impressed by the sharp, engaging and charming staff on reception, particular thanks to “ German” for sorting out breakfast for us..good man. But in all honesty all th staff were lovely. Stayed in room 503, with huge curved floor to ceiling picture windows looking across to the world trade centre and manhattan island...really couldn’t take my eyes off the view all stay... super room. The hotel is one stop on the subway to wtc and so access. To Manhattan couldn’t be easier. We ate a couple of times out the jersey side as well - very afffordable, good value and good food. I couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough, when we checked in “German” explained that once we had experienced it we wouldn’t book in New York again...he is completely right... go it’s just brilliant.\")\n",

Steps outside the hotel you can see the amazing view of Manhattan. Room was big and beds were very comfortable. There's even a couch with a chaise lounge in the room. If your not afraid of public transportation, the PATH is right outside the hotel which takes you right to the One World Trade Center/Oculus which is a hub for almost every subway train. Oculus is beautiful and has shops along with a food court inside so it's very accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you want to see the New York city for a good price.\")\n",
